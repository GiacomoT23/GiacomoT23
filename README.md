# 👋 Hi there, I'm Giacomo

Curiosity has always been the common thread in my path. I began in **Computer Engineering**, then moved into the world of **AI applied to health and life sciences** with a Master’s in **Biotechnologies & Applied AI for Health**. After my thesis, I continued with a **research fellowship** on genomic AI models, working on tasks in **genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics**.  

What excites me most is the versatility of AI: I’ve applied it across different domains in biology and health, and I’m now diving deeper into **large language models** and NLP. I like exploring how ideas from one field can spark solutions in another—and I try to keep the process both rigorous and creative.

## 🎭 Outside the Lab & Code

Beyond research and coding, I like to keep things varied: sports to stay active, chess for strategy (and humility), and a constant stream of random curiosities that keep me exploring. I value minimalism, but never take myself too seriously—because a bit of irony makes even the toughest problems easier to tackle.
